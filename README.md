This project was done in inspiration by a lot of portfolio website and just simply for convenience sake of having a private file sharing server. 
Following tutorials and then creating a Rust backend server for which this repository is mostly responsible for.

The frontend is designed and commisioned to Nadia my friend. Using Next.js to adapt and develop the design made in Figma.
